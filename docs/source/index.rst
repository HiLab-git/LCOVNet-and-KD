Welcome to PyMIC's documentation!
===================================

PyMIC is a pytorch-based toolkit for medical image computing with annotation-efficient 
deep learning. PyMIC is developed to support learning with imperfect labels, including 
semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning, and learning with noisy annotations.

Check out the :doc:`installation` section for install PyMIC, and go to the :doc:`usage`
section for understanding modules for the segmentation pipeline designed in PyMIC. 
Please follow `PyMIC_examples <https://github.com/HiLab-git/PyMIC_examples/>`_
to quickly start with using PyMIC. 

.. note::

   This project is under active development. It will be updated later.
